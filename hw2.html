						<p>
							The American Society of Magazine Editors has overhauled its guidelines, clearing away hurdles that sought to prevent editors from creating advertising content or publishers from selling ads on magazine covers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike the old guidelines, where discouraging cover ads was the first item on the list, now there's no specific language dissuading publishers from selling cover ads. And when it comes to editors collaborating alongside advertisers, the new principles simply say, "Editors should avoid working with and reporting on the same marketer." They previously said, "Don't Ask Editors to Write Ads."
						</p>
						<p>
							The old guidelines were intended to protect readers' confidence in editors' independence from advertiser influence. ASME, as the editors' organization is known, say the new guidelines serve the same purpose.
						</p>
						<p>
							Certain journalism stalwarts might see the revisions as a surrender: With the wall between advertising and editorial eroding, the trade group for magazine journalists watered down its guidelines to appease advertisers. But ASME CEO Sid Holt said that's not the case.

						<h2> EVENT DESCRIPTION </h2>
						<p>The Federal Trade Commission hosted a one-day workshop to examine the blending of advertisements with news, entertainment, and other editorial content in digital media, referred to as “native advertising” or “sponsored content.” The workshop brought together publishing and advertising industry representatives, consumer advocates, academics, and self-regulatory groups to explore the ways in which sponsored content is presented to consumers online and in mobile apps; consumers’ recognition and understanding of it; the contexts in which it should be identifiable as advertising; and effective ways of differentiating it from editorial content. The workshop was free and open to the public.
